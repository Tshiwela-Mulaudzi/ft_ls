# ft_ls
The Unix's command ls. 

The project is pretty much the Unix's command ls. It caters for -l, -a, -t, -r, and -R. In -l howevever,
i failed to get blocksizes' sum and i ended up including a code I found on StackOverflow(countblocksize.c)
which does that separately.

There is a lot of cleaning up still needed, but for now, this is it...
